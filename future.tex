\section{Future Nuclear Projections}

The future of nuclear energy in \gls{EU} nations is organized
in the table by the World Nuclear Association \cite{world_nuclear_association_nuclear_2017}.
It is assumed that all the planned constructions are completed in their expected date without delay
or failure. Also, the newly constructed nuclear power plants are assumed to have a lifetime of 60 years.

\Cref{tab:eu_deployment} lists the reactors that are currently under construction or planned.

For each \gls{EU} nation, the growth trajectory is categorized from
"Aggressive Growth" to "Aggressive Shutdown". Aggressive growth is
characterized by a rigorous expansion of nuclear power while 
Aggressive Shutdown is characterized as a transition to rapidly
de-nuclearize the nation's electric grid. A nation's growth trajectory is
categorized into five spectra:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Aggressive Growth
	\item Modest Growth 
	\item Maintenance
	\item Modest Reduction
	\item Aggressive Reduction
\end{itemize}

The growth trajectory and specific plan of each nation in the \gls{EU} 
is listed in Table \ref{tab:eu_growth}.
